    <h1>Fleabag</h1>

    <p>
        Pictured above is the titular character of the show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleabag">Fleabag</a>,
        played by the writer and creator of the show, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Fleabag is sarcastic and self-deprecating but loyal to those she cares about,
        despite being estranged from them. She often breaks the fourth wall, inviting the viewer to see her at her most relatable and most vulnerable moments.
        She's no hero, but her growth throughout the show makes her well-endeared by the Fleabag audience.
    </p>
    <h2>Here's why I admire her:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>She's committed to the bit</li>
        <li class="important">She's played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge</li>
        <li>She's a bad person but at least she's self-aware</li>
        <li>She's the queen of dissociation</li>
    </ul>
